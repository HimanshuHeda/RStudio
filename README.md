**R Studio Project**

**üìò Introduction**
This repository showcases a collection of projects and analyses conducted using R Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language. These projects focus on data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning, providing practical insights and tools for beginners and advanced users alike.

R Studio is widely used in academia, research, and industry for its powerful capabilities in handling complex datasets and performing in-depth data analysis.

**üõ†Ô∏è Features**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and organize datasets for effective analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Application of various statistical methods and hypothesis testing.
Data Visualization: Creation of interactive and publication-ready plots using ggplot2 and plotly.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.
Reproducible Reports: Use of R Markdown for generating reports and presentations.
